    <h1>Questions?</h1>
    <div id="Qs">Here are some commonly asked questions by parents or guardians: <br> 
      <br> <strong> Q: Will all campers get a role in the show?</strong> 
    <br> A: Yes! All campers have speaking roles and anyone who would like to may have a singing solor or duet!
    <br><br>
      <strong> Q: What if my child does not want to/cannot perform? Can they still  be part of the camp? </strong>
    <br> A: Yes! Of course! The camp offers a wide selection of fun activites like games and painting-not just performing! 
    <br><br>
      <strong> Q: If my child is doing VBS, how does that work? </strong>
    <br>A: When VBS meets in the morning, there will be bins in the church foyer for campers to put their luch boxes and scripts. Following VBS we personally pick up all campers and make sure they are accounted for. Then we walk down to the cafeteria and they eat their packed luches for the first half an hour before the other campers arrive!
